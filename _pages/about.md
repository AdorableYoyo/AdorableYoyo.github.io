  <p>I‚Äôm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at CUNY Graduate Center, where I build AI systems that decode biology and reimagine drug discovery‚Äîthink virtual humans simulating how drugs work before trials begin. I‚Äôm advised by Dr. Lei Xie (The City University of New York & Weill Cornell), and my work spans large language models, multi-modal learning, computational biology, and precision medicine.</p>

  <p>My path here wasn‚Äôt exactly linear: from circuit boards (undergrad in electronic engineering), to fashion (ran my own clothing store for 3 years), to data science (MS), and now to machine learning for biology. I never stop challenging myself‚Äîand that‚Äôs the fun part.</p>

  <p>In summer 2023, I spent 6 months at Genentech, where I worked across Clinical Pharmacology and Research Biology to develop an AI model for survival prediction‚Äîintegrating genomics and clinical data to guide personalized therapy.</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm excited by big questions like:<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Can we simulate an individual‚Äôs biology before testing a drug?<br>
  ‚Ä¢ What if we could transfer knowledge from one disease to another?<br>
  ‚Ä¢ How close are we to a universal foundation model of human health?</p>

  <p>Let‚Äôs find out ü§ó.</p>
