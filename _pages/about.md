    <p>I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Drug Discovery, Northeastern University, where I develop AI systems that bridge molecular mechanisms to whole-body physiology. My work focuses on creating multi-scale learning algorithms that predict drug interactions and optimize treatments for individual patients. I am also exploring uncertainty-aware reinforcement learning to make generative AI models more reliable for scientific and therapeutic decision-making.</p>
    
    <p>I am also a Co-Founder and AI/ML Scientist at Dark Matter Therapeutics, where we aim to translate the concept of virtual humans into practice‚Äîusing AI-driven modeling to accelerate precision drug discovery.</p>
    
    <p>I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the Graduate Center, The City University of New York, advised by Dr. Lei Xie (CUNY, Weill Cornell Medicine, and Northeastern). My doctoral research focused on large language models, multi-modal learning, meta-learning, and self-supervised learning for computational biology and precision medicine, building AI frameworks that decode complex biological systems and simulate drug responses before clinical trials.</p>
    
    <p>Previously, I worked at Genentech, developing machine learning models that integrate genomic and clinical data for patient survival prediction and personalized therapy design.</p>
    
    <p>My path to AI and biology has been interdisciplinary: starting in electronic engineering, evolving through entrepreneurship in fashion retail, advancing through data science, and culminating in machine learning for biology. I never stop challenging myself, and that's the fun part.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>I'm inspired by questions like:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 25px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>Can we simulate an individual's biology before testing a drug?</li>
      <li>What if knowledge could transfer seamlessly from one disease to another?</li>
      <li>How close are we to a universal foundation model of human health?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Let's find out ü§ó.</p>
